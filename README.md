# Modell_NXT

This project is used to connect a LEGO NXT Brick to the Virtual Representation Framework (https://github.com/sebbader/VirtualRepresentationFramework). Therefore the Lejos API for NXT is used (http://www.lejos.org/). A bit more specific it's the implementation that connects to a NXT via bluetooth and catches data from stream and pushes them to a MySQL database.
